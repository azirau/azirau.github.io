                This place is new to me, and I am confused on what I am supposed to do here. I brought a pre-built 
                internet page. However, I went to a different timeline, which is irritating. I spent a good several
                hours trying to find alternatives to this places "HTML", of which the ones I found are not well made.
                <br><br>
                I found some rather promising projects, PugJS being closest to what I need. c2's concepts being the 
                closest to what the original page was made in. HAML looked good, and MEML looked okay. Some of these
                I even doubt many others know about. I also discovered YAML, and XML. All of these after I discovered
                Unitors are called "markup languages" here. All of these usually were 3/4 characters in length. Using
                this place's government web index, named "Google" which is an interesting name.
                <br><br>
                Not sure why this government has multiple services it provides to people. However, later today I will
                be signing up for one of the government provided non-live chat, known as Reddit. Where I am from, this
                isn't a big thing. The government makes one service and names it once. Like NXNLChat, which is a lot like 
                "Reddit" from what I can tell.
