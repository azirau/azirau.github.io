            &gt; This site is highly modified from the original, and for good reason.
            There is a lot I had to translate and re-create in order to push this
            public's eye. <br>
            &gt; I also refrained from redoing the styling. This place seems to have
            a lot of work to do for web development. <br>
            &gt; I am consistently doing research on this place. So I also created a 
            <a href="jason-blog.html">blog</a> on how this place is different from
            where I am from.

        <p> If you wish to contact me, I am available at one of the first government mail services i stumbled upon that
            wasn't Gmail, as it seems like the government here has multiple different services for email, and I didn't Gmail
            as pronouncing it is difficult. "guhmail". So stupid. <br> jason.madison2871@mail.com
