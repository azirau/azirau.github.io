        <p>The project was a complete failure by the government of Naxius.
            It was basically supposed to be a time machine, but we missed
            some bit of information. I am now unable to relay information 
            back to the Naxius Space Centre. I cannot even access websites
            like NSC.gov.nx where I thought I could contact them. However,
            from what I can tell, Naxius is completely different to whatever
            government I am in. And even then, there is a lot pushing against
            what I currently understand of this place. <br>
            The project was for Naxius to kill people in the past, and they
            are an imperialistic dictatorship. I am still trying to find the
            legal and government owned news site, hopefully then can I fully
            describe what I know on this project. That way, I can give the
            story as people here will understand it.
